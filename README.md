## Preface

Hello!

Algorithms is the soul of programs. But I am a green hand in this field. Now I am trying to learn them well, to open my mind in thinking how to write elegant code.

If my code did help you, would you please give me a Star 🌟? It will courage me to move on! Thank you!

**No doubt that I would made some mistakes in it, if you find some bugs, please issue me. I am looking forward to discuss with you about the magic of Swift! Thank you!**

## Why Swift X?

Because Swift is an updating programming language, it has a lot of new features and changes between different versions.

Currently, Swift versions are 3.0.1 (Xcode 8.2.1) & 3.1 (Xcode 8.3 beta). And it will be updated to 4.0 this year.

So I try to use X to overview the version of Swift to adapt to the newest Xcode.
